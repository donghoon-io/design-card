    "In this study, the authors found that the low-literacy population preferred larger and medium-sized widgets, as well as radio buttons, when using touch screen interfaces on mobile devices. This suggests that designers should create larger widgets with feedback mechanisms to better accommodate this population.",
    "The authors conducted two co-design sessions with 12 children to investigate their perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences. The results showed that children accepted certain parental controls, and preferred controls that emphasized restriction, taught risk coping, and automated interactions.",
    "The authors evaluated the effects of transparency on the UX of autonomous driving, and found that explanations during/after the ride can help mitigate negative user experience. They contribute an initial guideline for autonomous driving experience design, combining the areas of UX, explainable AI, and autonomous driving."
